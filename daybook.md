# Project Diary:

**16-10-22**: For the first few weeks, I have been thoroughly going through tutorials on how to use Unity and C# and focusing on the platform aspects of my game, for example, player movement, how environment can affect players and level design. I have also been scouring the internet for royalty free character models and environment assets that I will be able to use in my game.

**23-10-22**: This week, I have been going through free asset packs and picking out potential sprites I would like to use in my game. I have also been attempting to map out the first level of the game in order to block out where the nature elements will come into play, as well as where to place enemies, and where the player will initially start on the screen. This week has been particularly difficult to do any work of significance as there was a project due last week, but as it is now finished, I should be able to start coding for the player movement next week. 

**02-11-22**: I have now started progress on the project. I have coded the start of the player movement by manipulating the character model into moving left and right across the screen as well as the speed in which it moves. My next plan is to start coding the next parts of the project which will be to allow the player to use gravity in order to jump as well as start importing new assets into the project. 

**13-11-22**: I have redone the movement mechanics of the game and have also implemented a RigidBody feature that I have utilised. I have also added a jumping feature that has a different speed to the regular speed so that the player doesn't jump too far. I will continue to watch more tutorials and look at other resources for inspiration on how to add more features to my game as well as learn more about the Unity UI itself.
