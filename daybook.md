For the first few weeks, I have been thoroughly going through tutorials on how to use Unity and C# and focusing on the platform aspects of my game, for example, player movement, how environment can affect players and level design. I have also been scouring the internet for royalty free character models and environment assets that I will be able to use in my game.
