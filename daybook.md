# Project Diary:

**16-10-22**: For the first few weeks, I have been thoroughly going through tutorials on how to use Unity and C# and focusing on the platform aspects of my game, for example, player movement, how environment can affect players and level design. I have also been scouring the internet for royalty free character models and environment assets that I will be able to use in my game.

**23-10-22**:  This week, I have been going through free asset packs and picking out potential sprites I would like to use in my game. I have also been attempting to map out the first level of the game in order to block out where the nature elements will come into play, as well as where to place enemies, and where the player will initially start on the screen. This week has been particularly difficult to do any work of significance as there was a project due last week, but as it is now finished, I should be able to start coding for the player movement next week.
