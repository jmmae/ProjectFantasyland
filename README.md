# Final Year Project

In order to play the game on the Unity Game Engine, please download the **ProjectFantasyland** folder to access the assets, packages, and the project settings. Make sure they are all in one folder, and the game will be able to play upon start up of the engine. You are able to create a build for this game which will allow the game to function in as an exe file. 

Note: The FinalYearProjectCode folder is a folder that allows me to keep track of changes made to the code files. All code can be found in ProjectFantasyland/Assets/Scripts.
