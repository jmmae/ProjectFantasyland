# Final Year Project

Welcome to **Project Fantasyland**! Project Fantasyland is a 2.5D platformer game which was created in the Unity Game Engine using C#. The objective of the game is to traverse through the level by defeating monsters, collect coins and health points, in order to collect the missing key at the end of the level. 

There are three levels to play through with increasing difficulty. Each level will have more enemies with different levels of health and bonus hearts can be earned throughout the game. The coins collected will be used for an in-game store where the player can change their player skin. Lastly, each key collected will unlock the next level.

In order to play the game on the Unity Game Engine, please download the **ProjectFantasyland** folder to access the assets, packages, and the project settings. Make sure they are all in one folder, and the game will be able to play upon start up of the engine. You are able to create a build for this game which will allow the game to function in as an exe file. 

Note: The FinalYearProjectCode folder is a folder that allows me to keep track of changes made to the code files. All code can be found in ProjectFantasyland/Assets/Scripts.
